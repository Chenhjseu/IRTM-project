# IRTM-project
This is the impletation of IRTM project -- Character Network of Rainbow Six.
Key techniques in Implementation
## •  Name Entity Recognition
To identify all the character names showed up in the novel, which will be used inthe later processes for co-occurrence counting and sentiment score calculation.
## •  Matrix Multiplication
To  vectorise  and  speed  up  the  calculation  of  character  co-occurrence,  imple-mented with numpy
## •  Network Visualization
To generate the network graph from data in co-occurrence and sentiment matrix,implemented with networkX
